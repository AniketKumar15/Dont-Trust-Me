# Don't Trust Me

## About

*Don't Trust Me* is a mind-bending top-down puzzle game where deception is the only constant. Every level presents you with a hint—but here's the catch: the hints are always wrong. To progress, you must do the opposite of what the game tells you.

As you navigate through increasingly tricky puzzles, a mysterious character named Koko appears to "help" you. But can you really trust them? With each level, doubt creeps in. Who is truly in control—you, or the lies you've been following?

This is just a **demo (or prologue) version**, featuring **six levels**. More content, puzzles, and story depth will be added in future updates.

## Features
- **Deceptive Puzzles** – Every hint is a lie. Can you figure out the real solution?
- **Mysterious Narrative** – Unravel the truth behind Koko and their cryptic messages.
- **Engaging Mechanics** – Push boxes, press buttons, and manipulate the game world in unexpected ways.
- **Mind-Twisting Logic** – Challenge your perception and think beyond the obvious.
